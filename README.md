# Azure_DE_Project
Created Azure DE project based on ETL where extracted data from source and done some transformation and loaded into azure synapse analytics

üöÄ Thrilled to Share My Latest Azure Data Engineering Project! üöÄ

I‚Äôm excited to showcase a comprehensive data engineering project that leveraged the full suite of Azure tools to streamline and enhance our data workflows. This project exemplifies how Azure‚Äôs ecosystem can be harnessed to deliver powerful and efficient data solutions. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at the project:

üîç Project Overview:

1. Data Source & Ingestion:

Source: We began with data sourced from Azure SQL Database.
Ingestion Tool: Utilized Azure Data Factory (ADF) to orchestrate the data ingestion process, ensuring a smooth flow from our source database into our data lake.
2. Data Storage & Layers:

Bronze Layer: The raw data was stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). This layer acted as our landing zone for unprocessed data.
Transformation Tools: Employed Azure Databricks notebooks to handle data transformations. The transformation process was divided into multiple stages:
Silver Layer Transformation: The first layer of data transformation was executed, converting raw data into a more refined state.
Gold Layer Transformation: Further refinement was carried out to prepare the data for analysis. The final Gold Layer contains the clean, aggregated, and enriched data ready for business intelligence.
3. Format Conversion:

Data Format: Initially, our data was in Parquet format, which is efficient for storage but required conversion for optimal performance.
Delta Format: We converted the data to Delta format using Databricks. Delta Lake provides ACID transaction support, scalable metadata handling, and unifies streaming and batch data processing.
4. Data Integration & Analytics:

Azure Synapse Analytics: Established a connection with Azure Synapse Analytics via a linked service. This enabled us to load the final Gold Layer data into Synapse, where it can be leveraged for advanced analytics and reporting.
End Result: The refined data is now available in tables within Synapse Analytics, ready for querying and visualization.
5. Security & Management:

Security Measures: Ensured robust security by using Azure Key Vault to manage and protect credentials and Azure Service Principal for secure access and management of resources.
üéØ Key Achievements:

Optimized Performance: By converting from Parquet to Delta format, we significantly enhanced query performance and data processing efficiency.
Streamlined Pipelines: Created a seamless data pipeline using Azure tools, improving data accessibility and usability.
Robust Integration: Successfully integrated data across multiple Azure services, providing a unified and scalable data solution.
üåü Highlights:

Leveraging Azure Data Factory for orchestration
Storing and transforming data using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Databricks
Optimizing data performance with Delta Lake
Integrating with Azure Synapse Analytics for powerful data analytics
